For this reason, they have conducted a survey and collected as much accurate information as possible about their customers' family sizes. The store wants to focus on the most recent 3 years of sales in the database and to separate customers into small families(1-3 children) and large families (3+ children). Here are some specific questions: \n",
    "- What's the average annual spend per child- by each adventureworks customer in the two types of families?\n",
    "- Is it true that large families with most of the children at home spend more throughout the year than in the direct run-up to Christmas? \n",
    "- What are the most popular 5-10 products for large and small families? Are these top products the same in both cases? Does it vary based on the % of children living at home that each customer has?\n",
