# Final Project Kickoff

## Scope

### Purpose
The aim of the final Project is to present the learners with a final opportunity to put their newly acquired skills into practice. The final project has to be scoped ad-hoc - case by case - both by the learner and the teaching staff. The ideal is that it represents enough of a challenge to learners, therefore they are pushed to extend their capabilities and refine their understanding of the different areas of Data Analysis. At the same time, the intention is NOT to provoque frustration or generate so much of a challenge for the learners to be unable to demonstrate skill. 

### Timeline 
Turn in all deliverables and meet all requirements by the end of Unit

### Learning Objectives: 
After this lesson, students will be able to: 

- Scope and manage a full data analysis project
- Look for interesting challenges to solve using available data and given time constraints
- Identify the best approach to solve the given business problem using data analytics skills
- Use PowerBI at a profesional level to visualize insights and present work
- Manage time and progress in an agile way

### Evaluation 

> :exclamation: Teachers Note: This is a Summative Assessment. That implies that we're looking forward to checking if the students are not only able to apply the technologies, but also they have a higher-level understanding of the context of the problem, the implications of their decisions, and a general framework of reference - conversations around the topic, ethics, paradoxes, market cases, state of technology, etc. -. For every learner, what implies a challenge might differ and we should accommodate for that diversity to emerge, but we shouldn't "lower the bar" at the point that we don't understand whether this student is understanding what's going on or they are just repeating techniques without reflection on their practice. What we are asking here is basically to level up their degree of sophistication when demonstrating proficiency.
